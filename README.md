Polyhedral modeling with [CD-GB](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cagd.2020.101828) patches based on [Jázmin Szörfi's work](https://3dgeo.iit.bme.hu/papers/multisided/polyhedral-design.pdf).

The implementation uses R7RS Scheme to generate the input ribbons. An interactive system is also implemented based on my [geometry framework](https://github.com/salvipeter/geo-framework).
