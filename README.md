# Molihua

Polyhedral modeling with [CD-GB](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cagd.2020.101828) patches based on [Jázmin Szörfi's work](https://3dgeo.iit.bme.hu/papers/multisided/polyhedral-design.pdf).

The implementation uses R7RS Scheme to generate the input ribbons. An interactive system is also implemented based on my [geometry framework](https://github.com/salvipeter/geo-framework).

CD-GB patches are generated by the [libcdgbs](https://github.com/VaitkusM/libcdgbs/) library by Márton Vaitkus.

# File format

The input is a Wavefront Obj file, with one simple modification:
a face with multiple loops should be followed by the comment
```
#h N
```
where `N` is the number of interior loops.
The next `N` lines are the interior loops described as faces with opposite orientation.
See some examples (e.g. `bogre.obj`) in the `models/` folder.
